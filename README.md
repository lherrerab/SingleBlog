#About CodeIgniter
CodeIgniter is a PHP framework that allows us to implement the MVC architecture in our web projects. If you have a clear idea about MVC, you'll find CodeIgniter really easy to develop your apps. 
Its documentation defines it as: "*CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries.*"

You can check the full documentation [here](http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/welcome.html)

#About Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a framework that offer us a lot of front-end tools to add in our web-apps. According to its [Github](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap): "*Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development, created by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton, and maintained by the core team with the massive support and involvement of the community.*"

#About MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL document database that help us to have a flexiblea and scalable application.  

We can find its full documentation [here](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/)

#Using this Repo

Once you have a clear idea about MVC and CodeIgniter, add this file into your webapp folder, this means, the one inside your web server. Check that the project already contains the CodeIgniter files so you won't need to download CodeIgniter.

Note: Before running the app, you need to start your mongoDB server and configurate your user params. The project uses [this GitHub](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/wiki/Using-MongoDB-in-Codeigniter) to admin the connection with MongoDB.
